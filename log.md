# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 20 or so: December 26, 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Second Milestone Project on Udemy course yesterday, Blackjack game. Today learned about decorators and took a look at Django and Flask.

**Thoughts:** I still had to look at the solution page to totally complete my Blackjack game but I am getting much much better. I am almost to my goal of 75% completion by the end of this week and that feels good

**Link to work:** I need to learn more about git and start uploading my notebooks to link here.
